# Threat Hunting

## Overview
This section documents proactive threat hunting activities performed in a simulated SOC environment. The goal is to identify suspicious or malicious behavior that may bypass traditional alerting mechanisms.

## Objectives
- Develop hypothesis-driven threat hunts
- Analyze logs and telemetry for abnormal behavior
- Identify attacker techniques using MITRE ATT&CK
- Improve detection coverage and SOC visibility

## Tools & Data Sources
- Wazuh / SIEM logs
- Windows Event Logs
- Sysmon
- Network traffic (PCAP where applicable)

## Hunting Methodology
1. Define a threat hypothesis
2. Identify relevant data sources
3. Execute queries and analysis
4. Validate findings
5. Document results and lessons learned

## Planned Hunts
- Suspicious PowerShell activity
- Credential access attempts
- Lateral movement indicators
- Persistence mechanisms

## Status
🚧 In progress — hunts will be documented as they are completed.
